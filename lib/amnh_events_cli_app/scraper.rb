class AmnhEventsCliApp::Scraper
  # the purpose of the scraper class is just to scrape data, and pass
  # the data to the Event class to make Event instances

  # You could just use class methods

  #self.scrape => get the data
  # once you have the data, create a new Event instance with each data set
